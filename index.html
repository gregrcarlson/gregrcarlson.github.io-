   <h4>Temperature Conversion</h4>
  <p>
    This ruby program will prompt the user for a temperature
    in degrees Celsius and let the user know what the
    corresponding temperature is in Fahrenheit.

   <h4>Ordinal Challenge</h4>
  <p>
    This ruby program will convert a plain number
    to the ordinal of the number. So for example,
    if the user enters 2, it will display 2nd, if
    the user enters 3, it will display 3rd, etc.

    <h4>Foobar</h4>
  <p>
    This ruby program is an adaptation of a classic technical
    interview problem which displays sequences
    of the Foobar pattern.
